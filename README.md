### Memo
Description
This was programmed and test in the language Jave in Eclipse IDE. This program accepts a user input of an integer that is 6 digits that will provide a case when the id number 897621 is inputed it will unlock and then when the user inputs an id number 897624 it will lock. It can only take inputs of numbers if there are 6 digits long otherwise the user will be prompted to enter a 6 digit id number. With coding I used if statements to transition between states. If the first input of the string was 8 then the state will transition from state 0 to state 1 and it will contrinue to transition to the next state until the entire id is entered. If a input string is not the correct integer then the sate will transitoin to state 0.

Test Usage


How to execute Finite State Machine:
After you clone my repository you are going to "cd repo_Alec" and then type ls to make sure your are in the right directory with file name FiniteStateMachine.java. You are next going to compile the java program by entering "javac FiniteStateMachine.java" if you errors arise then lastly enter "java FiniteStateMachine.java" and the program should run then you should be able to input the ID number 897621 to unlock and 897624 to lock
